The level of the Dynamism required depends on the changes that the Dynamist wishes to wreak upon the target. Minor or cosmetic changes will fall under the purview of low-level Dynamisms, while high-level effects can heal grotesque injuries, warp a form into another shape completely, or alter one creature into another. Manipulate usually affects the physical. For manipulations of the mind, the Influence Mode should be used instead.</p>\n<p>This mode is primarily used to psychically heal or cause wounds, or to increase the user&rsquo;s own natural Attributes as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Healing/Harming</strong>: 1 HP recovered/reduced per power level. Can also cure or cause disease by healing/ inflicting 1 disease level per power level. Heal/Harm effects only affect living beings, and the standard Manipulate rules for duration are waived. All Heal and Harm effects have a Range of Touch. The range can be increased to line of sight at a penalty of -5 to the roll.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Alcmene is hiding behind a large rock with an escaped peasant she is trying to help. The boy is hurt and has taken 8 Hit Points of damage. Alcmene presses her hand over the wound and concentrates. To heal the entire 8 points is a DoD-8.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Increased/Decreased Skill Rating</strong>: +1/-1 in Skill Rating per power level.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Finally, in the woods, Alcmene and the peasant boy use stealth to move away unseen from the pursuing guards. Alcmene, being an Oread Nymphas, has no trouble sneaking away but the boy is clumsy with little ability (Stealth+2). Alcmene uses her vast abilities to increase the boy's skill, giving him an additional +6 to his skill increasing it to a +8. This use of her powers has a DoD-6 to her roll.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Increased/Decreased Attribute</strong>: +1/-1 in Attribute per 3 power levels (PER is changed using the Sensory Mode instead).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Alcmene realizes that they cannot hope to outrun the guards who are dogging their trail. She may be doomed, but the boy does not have to be. Alcmene stops and enhances the speed of the boy so that he may escape. She increases the boy's SPD+0 to +4 with her ability with a DoD-12. The boy thanks and blesses her and moves off at a great speed through the woods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Alter Protection Rating</strong>: The PR of the Dynamism user's skin can be enhanced +1 per 3 power levels.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Alcmene, tired of running, turns to face her pursuers. She draws her thorn blade and with sheer force of will hardens her skin, covering it with bark. She gives her skin PR4 armor (DoD-12) of bark and vines, and slowly walks toward her hunters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Minor Manipulation (Level 5)</strong>: Alters facial features of living beings or the form of small objects no larger than a small child.</p>\n<p><strong>Significant Manipulation (Level 10)</strong>: Alters one humanoid to another humanoid species, provides unnatural alterations such as feathers or grass instead of hair, or changes the form and material of objects no larger than an average adult human.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Manipulation (Level 15)</strong>: Alters one species into any other; transforms 5m x 5m of any one non-living object into any other substance; i.e. stone to metal, metal to wood, or soil to water.</p>\n<p><strong>Complete Alteration (Level 20)</strong>: Alters any living being in any way imaginable; flesh to stone, etc. Also alters 20m volume of any non-living material into any other &mdash; even living &mdash; substances. This is the only way in which life can be created Dynamistically, short of divine intervention. The modifiers and effects of Manipulate Dynamisms always stack. A Dynamist turning himself into an eagle would be activating a Major Manipulation (Level 15). If he wished to enhance the DR of his talons by +1, he could activate the Major Manipulation at Level 18, including the +3 Dynamism levels required to enhance or reduce DR ratings by 1 point.</p>\n<p>Beings altered into other species maintain their Attributes and usable skills unless the Dynamism specifically reduces the scores.</p>\n<p>If the subject was injured before any transformation effects, he or she remains damaged afterwards unless a healing Manipulate Dynamism is activated. Activated as a counter-Dynamism, Manipulate effects can restore objects or beings affected by Manipulate Dynamisms back to their original forms, including \"un-healing\" any recovered damage.</p>","order":-1,"version":1,"skillid":"","skill":"mode","attribute":"DYN","specifier":"manipulate","specifierCustom":"health","level":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/lightning.svg","effects":[],"_id":"FXQgZUpi4hXTGLH4"}

Perception is not limited to what the Hero can see, hear, smell, or touch, but could also be used to enhance a person's empathy, allowing him to discern how a person is feeling or if they are telling the truth. The level of the Dynamism is added to the Hero's PER when trying to sense.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Alcmene knows that she is talking to a liar and wants to get at the truth. She uses her Sensory mode to detect lies. She successfully cast the Dynamism at level 10 and may now add +10 to her PER + Deduce Motive when trying to root out the lie.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Alcmene is in a dark cave and has a sight penalty of -6 to any sightbased actions. She uses her Sensory Mode to enhance her night vision, giving +6 to negate the darkness penalty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Locate Object/Person</h2>\n<p>The Sense Mode is used to divine the location of specific people, objects, and creatures. The Hero uses his Dynamism to add to his PER in order to find a person, place, or thing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Alcmene is in a forest looking for an entrance to an underground waterway. The GM decides that the metal grate is hidden under a pile of leaves 25m away and gives Alcmene a DoD-8 to find it. She reaches out with her Sensory ability with a range of 32m and an enhancement of +10 PER. The total DoD to cast the Dynamism is -14. Since the grate is within range, the GM allows her to roll her PER+10 versus the DoD-8. If the grate had been 50m away she would not be able to use her bonus since it was outside her range.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Scrying</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the most useful Sensory effect is clairvoyance &mdash; the ability to see into other locations via Dynamistic vision. The range of a clairvoyant Dynamism Power is limited to one kilometer per power level. Only the five standard senses are effective within a clairvoyant Dynamism Power.</p>\n<h2>Reverse: Obscure</h2>\n<p>The reverse of the Sensory Mode is Obscure, and it conceals objects, beings, and locations from both Dynamist and mundane detection.</p>\n<p>Use the Obscure Dynamism Power as the Difficulty Modifier against any attempts to divine what is being hidden. Obscure effects cannot be deployed to make anything truly invisible, rather they make them go unnoticed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Alcmene has the stolen amulet and is trying to get past a checkpoint where guards are searching travelers' belongings. Alcmene uses the Sensory Mode to obfuscate the amulet with a penalty of -8. When the guards search her things, they have a -8 penalty to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Alcmene is lying to the guard about where she is headed but doesn't trust her own abilities at hiding the truth.

Levitation, telekinetic movement, and all similar effects made possible by the Kinetic Mode require the Dynamism user's full attention and concentration to maintain. It is not possible to use other Dynamism Powers while levitating upward or while manipulating a target, though it is possible to leave the item or being suspended motionless in the air without canceling the Dynamism Power while the Dynamism user turns his or her attentions to creating another effect.</p>\n<p>A Kinetic Dynamism Power at level 1 can affect up to 50kg (STR +0), and allows the Dynamism Power user to control the target range up to 20 meters. For each 3 levels of the Dynamism Power (starting at level 3) the effect gains a +1 STR rating, and adds 50kg to the total weight allowance. Objects or creatures manipulated with this Mode travel at a default SPD of -4 and can be moved anywhere within the Dynamism Power's effective range. The focus of the power can be made to move faster by increasing the SPD level of the dynamism. For every +3 difficulty the SPD increases by +1.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Alcmene is escaping the symposium across a rooftop with a group of guards and an angry corrupt noble in pursuit. She comes to the edge of a building and needs to make it across to the next. Alcmene is a slightly built Nymphas and weighs only 50kg, so there is no penalty for her weight. However, she wants to move quickly across and at a SPD of +0 instead of the standard SPD-4; this is a&nbsp;-12 to the roll. The total DoD for the Dynamism roll is -12.</p>\n<p>The Dynamist causes the air under her to solidify as she moves across to safety.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The STR rating of any Kinetic effect must be divided between holding and lifting the target. For example, the Dynamism user may wish to prevent a foe from fleeing his presence. A level-9 Dynamism Power would allow the Dynamism user to hold his opponent with a STR rating of +3. If the Hero also wished to levitate the target off the ground, he would have to add 6 more power levels for a lifting STR of +2 (enough to lift 75kg).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: In the mountains above the town later that day Alcmene finds the kidnapped peasant and flees with him. While escaping the corrupt noble, the peasant falls into a chasm and Alcmene uses her Dynamism to catch and pull him up. The peasant is a large boy weighing 100kg (DoD-3 for the additional 50kg), and additional -6 DoD for the STR+2 to lift the young man back up. If she wanted to make him move faster, she could also add -6 to increase the SPD from -4 to -2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Grappling Attack</strong></p>\n<p>An action to grapple an opponent from a distance is possible using the Kinetic Mode. The Hero must first make a CR + Kinetic attack to hit the opponent, and if successful the level of the power being used acts as the STR and the DoD to later break the grapple. While grappled the target is rendered immobile or moves at a SPD of -4.</p>\n<p>Distant manipulations are certainly possible, such as pulling a lever from across the room or slamming and bolting a door from several meters away. These actions use the same rules for STR Rating as lifting or otherwise manipulating targets, and can also be used to wield a weapon or employ a physical ability such as juggling or writing. In this case, the Dynamism user's skills or Attributes are used to determine the success or failure of the manipulation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: A Dynamist using a Kinetic effect to unlock a door must make a Disable Mechanism roll after the Dynamism Power is activated.</p>\n</blockquote>","order":-1,"version":1,"skillid":"","skill":"mode","attribute":"DYN","specifier":"kinetic","specifierCustom":"kinetic","level":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/lightning.svg","effects":[],"_id":"Lpd4Ocx9uHQ1KtF5"}

The composition and appearance of an aura depends on the user, but the appearance of a Shield effect is always visible and apparent for what it is.</p>\n<p>Unless an Illusion effect is cast to conceal it, an aura is always visible to normal senses. Auras are air and light permeable, allowing the Dynamist to breathe and see. For this reason, these Dynamisms do not protect against blinding lights or harmful gasses.</p>\n<p>The aura also moves with the Dynamist. Only a single protective aura may be worn at a time. If a second aura is cast on the same target, only the aura offering greater protection remains. Auras have 2 hit points per Dynamism Level. All DR from attacks on the wearer of an Aura is subtracted from the Aura itself. Once an Aura is reduced to zero Hit Points, all further DR is done to the Hero.</p>\n<p>While protected by a protective aura, a Hero is immune to the special effects of critical hits in combat, since there is no way to \"go around\" an aura to hit a vulnerable spot. Nondamaging attacks such as grapples, disarms, and other stunts take their normal effect on a success.</p>\n<h2>Barriers</h2>\n<p>Barriers create a stationary two-dimensional shield of energy that can take whatever simple shape the caster desires. Like personal auras, their appearance depends on the Hero. A barrier can be a wall of ice, a shield of arcane force, or a column of swirling winds, for example.</p>\n<p>Barriers have a Protection Rating equal to one-third the Dynamism Level. Thus a level-9 barrier would have a PR of 3. Barriers are immobile once created.</p>\n<h2>Wards</h2>\n<p>Wards, unlike barriers and auras, protect against certain specified threats or maladies instead of \"all damage.\" Wards can be cast upon living creatures or inanimate objects such as doors, locks, shields, etc. Ward Dynamisms can be cast to protect against (but not limited to) the following effects and conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A type of weapon: such as handheld weapons, missile weapons, or claws.</li>\n<li>An elemental or environmental effect: such as heat, cold, electricity, acid, drowning, et cetera.</li>\n<li>A skill: commonly used vs. Disable Mechanism, Deception, Tracking, etc....</li>\n<li>A disease or plague.</li>\n<li>A single Mode: choose between the Modes, though it is not possible to create a Ward effect against Ward Dynamisms. Casting Ward Dynamism against the Attack Mode effectively functions as protection against Dynamism damage.</li>\n<li>Any single type of creature: choose a category such as insects, avians, natural predators, monsters, demons, etc. A Ward effect cannot be raised against overly broad categories such as all humanoids or summoned entities; it must be more specific.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An individual or item cannot be protected by more than one Ward of the same type. For example, it is not possible to be protected by a Ward vs. fire and Ward vs. ice. There is no restriction against the simultaneous use of different types of Wards, such as a Ward vs. fire and a Ward vs. the Influence Mode.</p>\n<p>Wards are not absolute protection. Against non-damaging effects (a Ward against pickpockets, or against Influence Mode), treat the Protection Rating of the Ward as a penalty to the attempt or a bonus to the resistance. Thus a level-10 Ward against pickpockets would give the thief a -20 to his or her attempt, while a level-10 ward against modes of Influence would give the target a +20 to their resistance roll. Against damaging effects, a Ward has a Protective Rating equal to 2 per level, and any damage that exceeds the Protective Rating damages the Ward itself, not the protected person or object. Damage done to the Ward reduces its HP, and if the HP is reduced to zero, the Ward collapses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Alcmene is searching for Khimira eggs below the city of Troy. Knowing that she will encounter the foul creatures in the labyrinth of caves below the metropolis, she creates a Dynamistic Ward protecting against Khimiras. She finally finds a cave full of eggs, but also encounters the clutch's mother. The Ward provides a Protective Rating of 20 and 20 Hit Points. If the Khimira cannot do more than 20 points of damage with its normal attacks, it will not be able to break the barrier that way. If, however, the Khimira can inflict 25 points of damage with a single attack, then it will be able to batter down the ward in 4 rounds, since each attack will do 5 points of damage to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All Dynamisms of this Mode have 2 hit points per Dynamism Level. All damage that would otherwise be done to a target protected by an aura, barrier, or ward Dynamism will be absorbed by the Dynamism. For example, a level-12 barrier has a Protection Rating of 4 and 24 Hit Points. If an enemy hits the barrier for 10 HP damage, the barrier takes 6 and has 18 HP remaining. A ward, being more specific, has a much higher Protection Rating, but anything other than that to which it is attuned will pass through the ward unaffected.</p>\n<h2>Reverse: Curse</h2>\n<p>When Ward effects are reversed and cast with malicious intent in order to render a being or item more susceptible to harm, the Dynamism is known as a Curse. These are cast in an identical manner to Ward, though rather than protecting the target against the named criteria, the Dynamism renders the being or item vulnerable, ensuring that the target suffers extra damage (+1 per 3 Dynamism Levels) from the threat or malady. In cases of Curses that do not inflict damage, they inflict the target with a penalty of some sort equal to -1 per level.</p>","order":-1,"version":1,"skillid":"","skill":"mode","attribute":"DYN","specifier":"shield","specifierCustom":"aura","level":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/lightning.svg","effects":[],"_id":"UWrNLgFbMkjtd1p5"}

The subject of an Influence effect will obey a single command from the Dynamism user, such as \"Halt where you are,\" \"Sleep,\" or \"Tell me your name.\" The command is sent into the subject's mind, and need not be spoken aloud unless the Dynamism user so desires. The subject will attempt to carry out the instruction to the best of its ability until the duration of the Dynamism Power elapses.</p>\n<p>No subject can be ordered to accomplish an instruction that contradicts its basic nature or abilities; for example, a person cannot be commanded to fly. Dangerous actions, such as attacking an enemy, can be commanded and obeyed, but blatantly harmful or suicidal actions will suffer penalties (at GM's discretion). This includes instructions to attack a being many times more powerful than the subject; commanding an unarmed civilian to attack an armored patrol might warrant a -10 penalty, while an experienced soldier would do so at only -1.</p>\n<p>The target of an Influence effect can resist being controlled by making a Resolve skill roll. For every 2 power levels, the target takes a -1 penalty to WIL.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Alcmene is at a symposium investigating a corrupt noble there. She shadows him to his private room and confronts the guards outside. As she walks past the guard she waves her hand and tells the guard \"You did not see me.\" Alcmene decided that the Dynamism level will be 12 and makes her roll, getting a success. The guard now has a DoD-6 to resist the Dynamism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, a Dynamism user may alter a target's scores in any mental- or social-type skill or Attribute. For example, a Dynamism Power that would see the target become forgetful or scared might have the same effect of lowering the target's INT or WIL ratings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Later, in the corrupt noble's room, Alcmene confronts the noble and asks where he is keeping the daughters of the peasants he is holding hostage. He refuses to answer but once again Alcmene uses her Dynamism power to loosen his tongue. She reduces his WIL by three points. The DoD of this is -9. She is again successful and the noble's resolve erodes and his tongue starts to wag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The subject of an Influence effect recalls the events that occurred while under the Dynamism Power's control. If the Dynamism user attains a Critical Success on the Dynamism Power roll, the target will believe the actions undertaken were his own idea and not suspect the influence of Dynamism, no matter how strange or uncharacteristic the deeds were.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Uses of the Influence Mode</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I psychically weaken his desire to search everywhere in the room, hoping I can convince him not to check the barrel where the bloodstained sword is hidden.\"</p>\n<p>\"I speak words of arcane commanding to the ghost, and demand that it serve me.\"</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I alter the summoned beast&rsquo;s rage so that it desires only to attack my foes.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>","order":-1,"version":1,"skillid":"","skill":"mode","attribute":"DYN","specifier":"influence","specifierCustom":"ranged","level":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/lightning.svg","effects":[],"_id":"XUusQg2xBK8KO53J"}

These illusionary effects will appear real, though they lack substance. The standard level-1 Illusion effect will register to a single sense (i.e. sight, but not touch, smell, taste, or hearing) but has no motion capabilities. For each +3 effect levels, the effect can include another feature, from the following list:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sensory Enhancement</strong>: Illusions can be enhanced by the addition of other sensory elements, such as sight, sound, taste, touch, and sound. Like all aspects of the Illusion effect, these sensory enhancements may seem real to others but will lack any actual substance.</li>\n<li><strong>Motion</strong>: A visual effect can also be made to move. The Dynamist must be within the effect's range and be able to sense the effect in order to control its motion. An Illusion effect may also be tied to an object or being so that it moves with the target; for instance, a Dynamist could wear an illusory cloak.</li>\n<li><strong>Details</strong>: The base illusion is relatively detailed, but only to a point. With this enhancement, the Illusion effect may take on a new depth of vivid detail, such as reproducing the exact features of a complex map, enhancing the perceived value and quality of an item, or perfectly copying the features of someone's face.</li>\n<li><strong>Magnitude</strong>: The sound, volume, brightness, and apparent size of the Illusion effect can be enhanced by increasing its magnitude:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>1 feature added: as loud as a shout, as bright as a torch, as big as a humanoid.</li>\n<li>2 features added: as loud as a trumpet, as bright as a campfire, as big as a horse.</li>\n<li>3 features added: as loud as a cheering crowd, as bright as a bonfire, as big as a wagon.</li>\n<li>4 features added: as loud as thunder, as bright as a lightning flash, as big as a house.</li>\n<li>5 features added: as loud as a hurricane, as bright as the sun, as big as a ship.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resisting Illusions</strong></p>\n<p>The Hero must have some inkling that an illusion is being used before he is allowed to detect if the phantasm is real or not.</p>\n<p>Dynamists can detect and resist any Illusion effect by using their PER + Illusion Mode skill, with the level of the effect being used as the Degree of Difficulty for the attempt.</p>\n<p>Beings without the Illusion Mode must rely on their wits and observation to determine if something is real or not. This is simulated by having the Hero make a PER roll versus the Illusion level as the DoD. Success indicates that the viewer suspects the Illusion effect to be unnatural or artificial in some way.</p>\n<p><strong>Invisibility</strong></p>\n<p>The Illusion Mode can be used to render a target invisible. Invisibility is a very complex effect as it must exactly mimic the environment around the target. Invisibility for a single, stationary individual is a level-10 effect (1 level for the basic illusion plus 9 levels of complexity). If the Hero wants to stay invisible while moving, add 3 levels for a total of 13.</p>\n<p><strong>Making Light</strong></p>\n<p>Illusion effects can also be used to produce illumination. A small, stationary globe of light is a simple level-1 illusion. By adding 3 levels, the ball of light will move with the Dynamist. This light can be used to blind enemies by directing it into their eyes.</p>\n<p>To accomplish this, the Dynamist must make a ranged attack roll using her CR + Illusion Mode rating with an additional penalty of -7 for aiming at a small location. If successful, targets are blinded for three rounds, +1 round for each magnitude feature added to the effect. Illusions can be produced anywhere within the range of the effect, and can also be activated while scrying, in which case the range of the effect is unlimited.</p>\n<p><strong>Example uses of the Illusion Mode</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I bend light away from myself, altering the flow of what is perceived by those around me and rendering myself invisible.\"</p>\n<p>\"I make the hidden gesture, pointing at my assailants and opening their eyes to the 'truth'; that they hold not swords but serpents!\"</p>\n<p>\"I create the illusion of my face resembling the Baron's, so I can infiltrate the party without suspicion.\"</p>\n</blockquote>","order":-1,"version":1,"skillid":"","skill":"mode","attribute":"DYN","specifier":"illusion","specifierCustom":"illusion","level":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/lightning.svg","effects":[],"_id":"b9HfTmISoaEnWlSR"}
